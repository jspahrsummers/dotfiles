INTRODUCTION                                                             *ag*

This plugin is a front for the cli executable Ag.  Ag can be used as a
replacement for grep.  This plugin will allow you to run ag from vim, and
shows the results in a split window.

:Ag[!] [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                               *:Ag*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given the first
    error is jumped to.

:AgAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                            *:AgAdd*

    Just like |:Ag|, but instead of making a new list, the matches are
    appended to the current |quickfix| list.

:AgFromSearch [{directory}]                                  *:AgFromSearch*

    Just like |:Ag| but the pattern is from previous search.

:LAg [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                *:LAg*

    Just like |:Ag| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed in
    the current |location-list|.

:LAgAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                          *:LAgAdd*

    Just like |:AgAdd| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are added
    to the current |location-list|

:AgFile [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                          *:AgFile*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for filenames matching the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the
    |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence.  <Enter> on
a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.

MAPPINGS                                                        *ag-mappings*

The following keyboard shortcuts are available in the quickfix window:

o                   open file (same as enter).

go                  preview file (open but maintain focus on ag.vim results).

t                   open in a new tab.

T                   open in new tab silently.

v                   open in vertical split.

gv                  open in vertical split silently.

q                   close the quickfix window.
